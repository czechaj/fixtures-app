# Fixtures App

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a basic e-commerce app for a furnitures company called Fixtures. I used a template from [HTMLDesign](https://html.design/), template can be downloaded from [this link](https://html.design/download/fixtures-furniture-html-template/).  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used Express.js on the backend and MongoDB as database. I also used bcrypt and express-validator for user authentication and connect-flash package for improving user interactions with flash messages. 
  <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two user roles on this website, admin and client. Clients can view products according to their categories, add them to their carts or leave them. Admin can manage categories and products. Several middlewares have been used to make admin actions more secure.
